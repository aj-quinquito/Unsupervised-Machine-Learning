    "## Executive Summary:\n",
    "In this project, I performed topic modeling on a dataset containing research papers categorized by subject, sourced from Kaggle. The objective was to identify hidden topics within the text data using two popular topic modeling techniques: LDA and NMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing phase involved cleaning and preparing the text data, which included standardizing case, removing stop words, lemmatizing, and tokenizing. Following this, I vectorized the data using various vectorization techniques (e.g., TF-IDF and CountVectorizer) to convert the text into numerical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed six LDA and NMF models using different sets of hyperparameters to identify the optimal models. The models were evaluated based on metrics like perplexity, coherence scores, and topic-word distributions. I visualized the best LDA model using pyLDAvis for interactive exploration of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate that *[insert best model here]* performed better at extracting meaningful topics relevant to the use case. The findings from the best model are discussed in detail, with recommendations for further improvements. The outcomes are expected to benefit stakeholders by providing deeper insights into research trends and themes within academic publications.\n"

      "Summary:\n",
      "['Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches.', 'Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.', \"We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.\", 'As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.', \"To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information, this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting archive. Macintosh utilities for binhex are available from mac.archive.umich.edu. QuickTime is available from ftp.apple.com in the dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime.\"]\n",

    "1. Interpretability:\n",
    "- LDA topics are well-separated and interpretable, focusing on high-level themes like energy, systems, and algorithms.\n",
    "- NMF provides fine-grained topics, but their interpretability might require domain-specific knowledge.\n",

    "2. Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LDA's perplexity (2324.47) is relatively low, indicating a better generalization for unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Sparsity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NMF has higher sparsity, which can lead to more interpretable topics but may miss overlapping themes.\n",
    "- LDA captures overlapping word usage better due to its probabilistic nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LDA provides overlapping word distributions across topics, making it better for capturing nuanced relationships.\n",
    "- NMF enforces non-negativity, ensuring that topics remain non-overlapping and concise."

    "After evaluating both the LDA and NMF models, the **NMF model** is chosen as the better fit for this use case. The dataset's structure, which includes subtopics within general topics, aligns more effectively with the interpretability and coherence of the topics generated by the **NMF model**. Here’s why the NMF model was selected:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quantitative Reasons:\n",
    "- Reconstruction Error: The NMF model demonstrated a significantly lower reconstruction error, indicating a better fit to the data compared to the LDA model's perplexity score.\n",
    "- Sparsity: The sparsity metrics for the NMF model highlight its ability to provide compact and interpretable representations of topics, reducing overlap and improving clarity.\n",
    "2. Qualitative Reasons:\n",
    "- Coherence of Topics: The NMF model produced topics with well-defined dominant words that clearly align with the dataset's general themes and subtopics, such as \"Data Science and Applications\" and \"Thermodynamics and Material Science.\"\n",
    "- Alignment with Dataset Structure: The subtopic-focused nature of the dataset favors NMF's deterministic approach to topic generation, resulting in more granular and interpretable topic clusters compared to the probabilistic LDA model.\n",
    "- Stakeholder Usability: The topics derived from the NMF model provide actionable insights and categorizations that align with the stakeholders' goals of extracting well-defined subtopics for further analysis or application.\n",
    "3. Limitations of the LDA Model:\n",
    "While the LDA model is effective in probabilistically identifying broader themes, its topics lacked the granularity and coherence required for this dataset's subtopic-focused structure. This reduced its usefulness for stakeholders who rely on precise topic delineations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NMF model effectively addresses the use case by providing granular, coherent, and interpretable topics that align with the dataset’s structure. This ensures that stakeholders can utilize the topics meaningfully for further categorization, analysis, or reporting."
