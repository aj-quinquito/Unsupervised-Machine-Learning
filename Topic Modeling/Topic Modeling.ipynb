    "## **Executive Summary**\n",
    "In this project, we performed topic modeling on a dataset containing research papers categorized by subject, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spsayakpaul/arxiv-paper-abstracts?select=arxiv_data.csv). The objective was to identify hidden topics within the text data using two popular topic modeling techniques: LDA and NMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing phase involved cleaning and preparing the text data, which included standardizing case, removing stop words, lemmatizing, and tokenizing. Following this, we vectorized the data using techniques like TF-IDF and CountVectorizer to convert the text into numerical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted a series of experiments to develop six LDA and NMF models with different hyperparameters. The models were evaluated based on metrics such as reconstruction error, coherence scores, and topic-word distributions. Additionally, we used pyLDAvis to visualize the topics generated by the LDA model for interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results demonstrate that the NMF model outperformed LDA in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. With a significantly lower reconstruction error and a higher number of interpretable topics, NMF proved to be more effective for this use case. Its ability to extract granular and coherent topics aligned well with the dataset's structure, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings from the best NMF model are discussed in detail, along with recommendations for further improvements. These outcomes are expected to benefit stakeholders by providing deeper insights into research trends and themes within academic publications, ensuring meaningful categorization and analysis."

      "Sample Text Data: ['Personalized article recommendation is important to improve user engagement on news sites. Existing work quantifies engagement primarily through click rates. We argue that quality of recommendations can be improved by incorporating different types of \"post-read\" engagement signals like sharing, commenting, printing and e-mailing article links. More specifically, we propose a multi-faceted ranking problem for recommending news articles where each facet corresponds to a ranking problem to maximize actions of a post-read action type. The key technical challenge is to estimate the rates of post-read action types by mitigating the impact of enormous data sparsity, we do so through several variations of factor models. To exploit correlations among post-read action types we also introduce a novel variant called locally augmented tensor (LAT) model. Through data obtained from a major news site in the US, we show that factor models significantly outperform a few baseline IR models and the LAT model significantly outperforms several other variations of factor models. Our findings show that it is possible to incorporate post-read signals that are commonly available on online news sites to improve quality of recommendations.', 'Among the various types of online language learner collective types, we analyze in this contribution Web 2.0 communities featuring an explicit progression. We use three analysis angles (user roles, pedagogical progression and content) in order to provides leads towards expressing the interrelations between the implementation choices regarding the concepts linked to Web 2.0 and the learning experience of the users.', 'This paper investigates the efficiency of an alternative to ratio estimator under the super population model with uncorrelated errors and a gamma-distributed auxiliary variable. Comparisons with usual ratio and unbiased estimators are also made.', 'Context. Among others, shocks are known to be accelerators of energetic charged particles. However, many questions regarding the acceleration efficiency and the required conditions are not fully understood. In particular, the acceleration of electrons by shocks is often questioned. Aims. In this study we determine the efficiency of interplanetary shocks for $<$100 keV electrons, and for ions at $\\\\sim$0.1 and $\\\\sim$2 MeV energies, as measured by the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT) instruments aboard the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. Methods. We employ an online STEREO in situ shock catalog that lists all shocks observed between 2007 and mid 2014 (observed by STEREO A) and until end of 2013 (observed by STEREO B). In total 475 shocks are listed. To determine the particle acceleration efficiency of these shocks, we analyze the associated intensity increases (shock spikes) during the shock crossings. For the near-relativistic electrons, we take into account the issue of possible ion contamination in the SEPT instrument. Results. The highest acceleration efficiency is found for low energy ions (0.1 MeV), which show a shock-associated increase at 27% of all shocks. The 2 MeV ions show an associated increase only during 5% of the shock crossings. In the case of the electrons, the shocks are nearly ineffective. Only five shock-associated electron increases were found, which correspond to only 1% of all shock crossings.', \"In order to attract, recruit and retain underrepresented minority students to pursue Astronomy and related fields, we must ensure that there continues to be a well qualified pool of graduate and undergraduate students from which to recruit. This required pool of people are today's elementary, middle and high school students. The Astronomy community must be proactive in demonstrating the importance of pursing scientific study and careers to these students and their parents. Only by actively engaging these communities can U.S Astronomy hope to increase the numbers of minority PhDs and continue to be a leader in Astronomical discovery and knowledge.\"]\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, both LDA and NMF offer unique advantages depending on the project’s objectives. LDA excels at extracting clear and interpretable themes with fewer topics, making it suitable for datasets with distinct clusters or domains. Its probabilistic approach provides smooth topic distributions, which can be effective for high-level thematic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "NMF, on the other hand, is well-suited for tasks that require high accuracy and detailed topic modeling. Its low reconstruction error and ability to handle dense datasets make it ideal for uncovering fine-grained patterns and relationships within the data."

    "### Experimentation and Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, various experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of LDA and NMF. Key aspects of the experimentation process included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tuning Hyperparameters:\n",
    "   - For LDA, parameters such as `num_topics`, `doc_topic_prior`, and `topic_word_prior` were adjusted to optimize coherence and perplexity.\n",
    "   - For NMF, different values of `num_topics` were tested to minimize reconstruction error and maintain topic interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Topic Count Observations:\n",
    "   - It was observed that NMF consistently performed better with a higher number of topics, as it allowed the model to capture more granular and detailed themes. For instance, using 45 topics yielded an extremely low reconstruction error of 0.00017855, demonstrating the model’s ability to reconstruct the data with high accuracy.\n",
    "   - LDA required fewer topics to achieve reasonable coherence and interpretability. However, with 10 topics, its coherence score was 0.5617, which is lower compared to NMF's reconstruction capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "   - NMF was evaluated based on reconstruction error and sparsity metrics. The low reconstruction error indicates its ability to model the data effectively while maintaining topic granularity.\n",
    "   - LDA, evaluated using coherence scores and perplexity, performed well in generating interpretable topics but lagged in capturing finer details due to its probabilistic nature."

    "### Reasons for Choosing NMF\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative Reasons:\n",
    "- Reconstruction Error: NMF demonstrated a significantly lower reconstruction error, indicating a better fit to the data compared to LDA's perplexity score.\n",
    "- Sparsity: NMF provided compact and interpretable topic representations, reducing overlap and improving clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative Reasons:\n",
    "- Coherence of Topics: The NMF model produced topics with well-defined dominant words that align with the dataset's structure, such as \"Software Design and Applications\" and \"Thermodynamics and Material Science.\"\n",
    "- Alignment with Dataset Structure: The subtopic-focused nature of the dataset favored NMF's deterministic approach, resulting in more granular and interpretable topic clusters compared to LDA.\n",
    "- Stakeholder Usability: The topics derived from NMF provide actionable insights and categorizations that align with stakeholders' goals of extracting well-defined subtopics for further analysis or reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of LDA:\n",
    "- While the LDA model effectively identified broader themes, its topics lacked the granularity and coherence required for this dataset's subtopic-focused structure. This reduced its usefulness for stakeholders requiring precise topic delineations."

    "### **Final Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project was to break down the data into detailed and accurate topics. After testing both models, **NMF** proved to be the better choice. It consistently performed well with higher numbers of topics and showed excellent results with its low reconstruction error, making it ideal for understanding complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes NMF stand out is how well its results match the structure of topics found in [arXiv's category taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy). The large number of topics NMF produced aligns with the many fields and subfields listed on the website. This shows that NMF can pick up on fine details and relationships in the data, similar to how arXiv organizes its research categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "NMF’s ability to identify these smaller, more detailed patterns fits perfectly with the project's goal to explore the dataset deeply. It not only uncovered meaningful topics but also matched them with real-world themes, proving it to be the right tool for the job."
